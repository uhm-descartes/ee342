# Problems in class

The first is a is a sequence of problems that involve "coin tossing",
sometimes with very strange coins (like in part 3 below). If you are
wondering, you could realize such "coins" by three _entangled_ quantum
electron-spins (often called entangled quantum bits or qubits).
Entangled qubits are a key ingredient in quantum computation. In a
similar fashion, while we talk of coin tosses, we are actually
thinking of binary state physical systems that could settle in each
state with certain probabilities. All quantum states are inherently
probabilistic, and a lot of quantum mechanics tracks these
probabilities. Indeed, what you learn in 342 and 345 is basically the
axiomatic foundation of quantum mechanics.


1. Consider three coin tosses (imagine each coin shows Heads or
	   Tails). At this stage, can you write the sample space?
	   Probabilities? How many distinct events do you have?

2. Suppose the coin tosses are fair and every sequence of coin
       tosses has equal probability. What is the probability
       assignment for this model? 

3. Instead, suppose we have a special coin, which we will call the
	   Zero-Parity coin. If you toss the coin thrice, you will only
	   see an even number of Heads among the toss outcomes (you will
	   never see 3 Heads for example). In addition, each sequence with
	   an even number of Heads has equal probability (whether the
	   sequence has 0 or 2 Heads among 3 coin tosses). What is the
	   probabilty assignment for this model?

4. Under each of the probability models, what is the probability
       we observe 2 Heads?
