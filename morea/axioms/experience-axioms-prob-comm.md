Consider the following abstract model of a perfect communication
  link. There is a transmitter and a receiver, and the transmitter
  transmits one bit through a channel. The transmitter chooses 0 or 1
  with equal probability. The channel faithfully reproduces the input,
  so the receiver sees the same bit transmitted by the channel.  Write
  a sample space and a probability assignment to model this problem.
