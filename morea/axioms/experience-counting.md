# Countability definitions

A bijective function $$f: A\to B$$ satisfies the property that for all
$$b\in B$$, there is exactly one $$a\in A$$ such that $$f(a) = b$$. So there
is a one-one correspondance between the elements of $$A$$ and $$B$$.
Clearly if there is a bijective function $$f$$ from $$A$$ to $$B$$, the
function has an inverse $$f^{-1}:B\to A$$ that is also a bijection.

By definition, the cardinality of $$A$$ and $$B$$ are equal if there is
a bijection from $$A$$ to $$B$$. This is how we compare infinite sets.

**Definition** All finite sets are countable. An infinite set $$A$$ is
_countable_ iff there is a bijection $$c:A\to \naturals$$, where
$$\naturals=\sets{1,2, \ldots$$ is the set of all natural numbers.

Your handout gives many examples of countable sets. Informally this means
that given an infinite sheet of paper and infinite time, you could write all
elements of $$A$$ one below another (because you can write natural numbers one
below another as a list). 

[Cantor](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) came up with a stunningly
beautiful argument to prove that the set $$[0,1]$$ is not countable.
While both $$[0,1]$$ and $$\naturals$$ have an infinite number of
elements, the size of $$[0,1]$$ is a bigger infinity than the size of
$$\naturals$$. 

There are any number of articles on this on the Internet, here 
is [one]().
