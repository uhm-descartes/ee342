The photo you see associated with this module is Andrey Nikolaevich
Kolmogorov (1903-1987), who has fundamentally transformed probability
theory, logic, topology, information theory, computational complexity
mechanics, and many other areas. His academic career started with his
contributions as an editor of the mathematical section of his school
journal at the age of 5---where he noticed that regularity in the sum
of the first $$n$$ odd numbers (the first $$n$$ odd numbers sum to
$$n^2$$). Kolmogorov also contributed our modern probability space
formulation at a later age.
