Use this material with caution. Not everything gets recorded from
class. 

In particular, what I am pointing to may not always appear in a
video. The questions asked by students may not always be audible. When
I move away from the desk to talk to students, the audio may fade. In
the flow of class, I may point to something on a different screen and
explain---but in the recording, you may only hear me (with fading) and
see what is written on the writing screen. Keep in mind also that in
the normal pedagogical structure, initial introductions may sometimes
be simplified "half-truths" that get clarified or refined down the
line---so do not use this material in isolation. All this could
contribute to miscommunication.

For those who followed along in class, this material may be
useful. That is the primary reason this is made available anyway.
