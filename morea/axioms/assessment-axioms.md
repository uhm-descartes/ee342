# Problems in class
There are four problems here. The first is a toy problem, but useful
nonetheless to fix notations. The remaining problems are from
communications, randomized algorithms and machine learning, and they
will be running problems. We will start off simple, and add more to
each of them as we come across new topics. 

1. The first is a is a sequence of problems:

	a. Consider three coin tosses (imagine each coin shows Heads or
	   Tails). At this stage, can you write the sample space?
	   Probabilities? How many distinct events do you have?
  
    b. Suppose the coin tosses are fair and every sequence of coin
       tosses has equal probability. What is the probability
       assignment for this model? 

	c. Instead, suppose the coin tosses are rigged. The person tossing
       the coin ensures that you only see an even number of Heads, but
       makes sure that all sequences with an even number of Heads have
       equal probabilities (whether 0 or 2 Heads among 3 coin
       tosses). What is the probabilty assignment for this model?

	d. Under each of the probability models, what is the probability
       we observe 2 Heads?

2. Consider the following abstract model of a perfect communication
  link. There is a transmitter and a receiver, and the transmitter
  transmits one bit through a channel. The transmitter chooses 0 or 1
  with equal probability. The channel faithfully reproduces the input,
  so the receiver sees the same bit transmitted by the channel.
  Write a sample space and a probability assignment to model this
  problem.

3. _QuickSort_ is a recursive, divide-and-conquer algorithm to sort a
  sequence. Some of you may have seen this before. Each call to
  QuickSort works as follows: given $$n$$ numbers to sort (in
  ascending order, say),
	a. pick a _pivot_ at random from one of the $$n$$ elements.

	b. all numbers $$\le$$ the pivot are placed in the left bin, and
       all numbers $$>$$ than the pivot are placed in the right bin
       (so we do $$n$$ comparisons to partition the numbers into left
       and right bins). The two bins may end up being unequal in size.

    Then Quicksort is called on each bin separately till we end up
	with bins of size 1. Because we also know the relative order of
	each bin, writing out all the elements in the order of bins gives
	the sorted sequence. This is an example of a randomized
	algorithm. Note that different sequences and different choices of
	pivots lead to different runtimes. Set up a probability space to
	model one step of Quicksort for a random permutation of a sequence
	of 4 distinct numbers. (You can assume without loss of generality
	that the input is a permutation of 1 through 4, do you see why?)

4. AI and Machine learning approaches almost always have a
    probabilistic setup. We consider what is called a classification
    problem. In the real line, imagine that a threshold (a number
    $$T$$) splits the line into two (infinite length) intervals. Each
    side of $$T$$ carries a different _label_, the left side of $$T$$
    carrying label -1 and the right side carrying label +1. The
    threshold $$T$$ is unknown (but fixed) to the _learning algorithm_,
    and the algorithm is supposed to figure this out.
	
	There is a pdf $$f$$ on real numbers. A training point is a real
    number $$x$$ generated by the distribution $$f$$. Once we generate the
    training point, an oracle that knows $$T$$ gives us its correct
    label.
	
    The learning algorithm takes this training point $$x$$ and its
    label, and uses it to output a hypothesis (its best guess of what
    the unknown threshold is).  
	
	For this problem, consider the following algorithm: If the label
    of the training point $$x$$ is -1, the algorithm outputs as its
    estimate of the threshold to be $$x+\frac12$$, labeling the left
    interval to be -1 and right to be +1.  If the label of the
    training point $$x$$ is +1, the algorithm outputs $$x-\frac12$$,
    again labeling the left interval to be -1 and right to be +1.
	
	Model the problem, and identify the event that the algorithm makes
    an error, and identify its probability in terms of $$f$$.  This is
    called the _generalization_ error.
