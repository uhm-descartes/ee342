AI and Machine learning approaches almost always have a probabilistic
setup. We consider what is called a classification problem. In the
real line, imagine that a threshold (a number $$T$$) splits the line
into two (infinite length) intervals. Each side of $$T$$ carries a
different _label_, the left side of $$T$$ carrying label -1 and the
right side carrying label +1. The threshold $$T$$ is unknown (but
fixed) to the _learning algorithm_, and the algorithm is supposed to
figure this out.
	
There is a pdf $$f$$ on real numbers. A training point is a real
number $$x$$ generated by the distribution $$f$$. Once we generate the
training point, an oracle that knows $$T$$ gives us its correct label.
	
The learning algorithm takes this training point $$x$$ and its label,
and uses it to output a hypothesis (its best guess of what the unknown
threshold is).
	
For this problem, consider the following algorithm: If the label of
the training point $$x$$ is -1, the algorithm outputs as its estimate
of the threshold to be $$x+\frac12$$, labeling the left interval to be
-1 and right to be +1.  If the label of the training point $$x$$ is
+1, the algorithm outputs $$x-\frac12$$, again labeling the left
interval to be -1 and right to be +1.
	
The idea is that since the algorithm does not know $$T$$, it will
classify points generated by $$f$$ using its estimate of the threshold
instead. There may therefore be some intervals on the real line where
the true label (set by $$T$$) and the estimated label (set by the
algorithm's estimate of the threshold) differ.  We say we
_misclassify_ points in such an interval.
	
Model the problem, identify the event that the algorithm misclassifies
points, and identify the probability of misclassification in terms of
$$f$$.  The probability of misclassification is called the
_generalization_ error.
