  <h1 id="quiz-3-and-4">Quiz 3 and 4</h1>

<p>Please submit on Laulima as instructed</p>

<h1 id="problems-in-class">Problems in class</h1>

<p>The four problems here are a developed from the corresponding
problems in the previous module.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Recall the 3-coin toss problem (Problem 1 from the previous module).</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Fair Coin: Suppose every sequence of coin tosses has equal
probability. Show that each coin toss has probability \(1/2\)
of being heads. What is the probability the first toss is heads
given the second and third tosses have the same face (ie. the
event that they are both heads or both tails)?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Zero-parity coin: This is a special coin such that if you toss
it thrice, you are guaranteed to see only an even number of
Heads.  However, all sequences with an even number of Heads
have equal probability (regardless of whether the sequence has
0 or 2 Heads among 3 coin tosses). What is the probability the
first toss is heads given the second and third tosses have the
same face (ie. the event that they are both heads or both
tails)?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Show that two tosses of either coin are independent. Show that 
 three tosses of the Zero-parity coin are <em>not</em> independent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Can you give another probability law on three coin tosses  such
 that the event: “first toss shows Heads” is independent of 
 any event you could construct only from the second and third tosses?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us build on our abstract model of a communication link. As before,
 there is a transmitter and a receiver, and the transmitter
 transmits one bit through a channel. The transmitter chooses 0 or
 1, but unlike the previous module, now the probability of a 1 is
 \(p\). Now the link is not perfect. Given any input, the channel
 flips the input bit with probability \(\epsilon\). This abstraction
 is called a <em>Binary Symmetric Channel</em>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Phrase this channel model in terms of conditional probabilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If \(\epsilon = \frac12\), show that the received bit is independent of the transmitted bit. In this case of course, the implication is that there is nothing we could do to reconstruct the transmitted bit.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We set up <em>QuickSort</em> in the last module. Please review the setup.
 You set up the probability space for a sequence of length 4. In the 
 first iteration, you would choose a pivot, say \(p_0\), and break
 the sequence into two, calling the procedure recursively on each
 subsequence.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Let \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) be the lengths of the two sequences when you split the length 4 sequence. What is the distribution of \(L_1\)? Of \(L_2\)? Is it intuitive that they should have distributions related that way?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This anticipates a future topic: given \(L_1\), what is the distribution of \(L_2\)?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When <em>Quicksort</em> is called on the two subsequences of length \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), each call produces a new pivot, say \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) respectively. Conditioned on any choice of \(p_0\), the two pivots are chosen independently. But are \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) independent? (You can tell whether they are independent without any calculation).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This question anticipates a future topic, but what is the <em>joint</em> distribution of \(L_1\) and \(L_2\)? We have not formally defined the joint distribution yet, but this problem helps you appreciate the need for one.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>We are handcalculating everything for now because we want to
  understand what is happening. Consequently, we are keeping the
  sequence length small. You could easily simulate everything we are
  doing here for larger sequence lengths. But simulations like this
  not only tend to be overkill, but also may not reveal much insights,
  because they carry too much detail (like the distribution of \(p_1\)
  and \(p_2\)) that are not really that important. If we are
  interested in running time, we will be able to identify a few
  summaries to keep track of (we will learn them in Expectations of
  Random Variables). We can often hand-calculate or estimate these
  summaries better and faster than any simulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AI and Machine learning approaches almost always have a
 probabilistic setup. We considered a classification problem in the
 prior module.  where a threshold (a fixed but unknown number
 \(T\)) splits the line into two (infinite length) intervals, the
 left side of \(T\) carrying label -1 and the right side carrying
 label +1. The threshold \(T\) is unknown and the learning
 algorithm is supposed to figure this out.</p>

    <p>Training points are generated by a pdf \(f\), which was left
 unspecified last module, but which we will now specify. To
 generate a training point from \(f\), first toss a biased coin
 whose two sides are \(-1\) and \(+1\), and whose probability of landing
 on \(+1\) is \(p\). If the outcome of the coin toss is \(-1\),
 we choose a number from \(T-1\) to \(T\), using a uniform pdf. If
 the coin toss is \(+1\), we choose a number from \(T\) to \(T+1\),
 using a uniform pdf.</p>

    <p>Our learning algorithm sees a training point \(x\) and its label. It
 does not know \(f\) nor does it know \(T\).
 If the label of the training point \(x\) is -1, the algorithm
 outputs as its estimate of the threshold to be \(x+\frac12\), If the
 label of the training point \(x\) is +1, the algorithm outputs
 \(x-\frac12\). The idea is that since the learning algorithm does not
 know \(T\), it uses its estimate of the threshold to classify
 points instead.</p>

    <p>a. What is the generalization error (the probability another
   point generated from \(f\) is misclassified by the threshold
   estimated by the learning algorithm) given a specific training point \(x\)?</p>

    <p>b. What is the generalization error? The distinction between this
   and the prior quesiton motivates the topics in the next module.</p>
