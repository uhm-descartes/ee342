1. There are three concepts in this module:
    * Conditional pmf/pdfs
	* Taking expectations with respect to (conditional) pmf/pdf on $$X$$ conditioned on an event $$A$$, $${\mathcal E} [ X| A]$$ 
	* The special random variable: $${\mathcal E} [X| Y]$$, a function of $$Y$$, and not a nubmer like $${\mathcal E} [ X| A]$$ 

2. If we want to estimate a rv $$X$$ (that we do not get to see), but
 make an observation $$Y$$, then $${\mathcal E}[X|Y]$$ is the best
 estimate of $$X$$ (in the mean square sense)
 
3. Covariance, correlation, conditional variance

4. Law of iterated expectations $${\mathcal E}\bigl[{\mathcal
   E}[X|Y]\bigr] = {\mathcal E} X$$

4. $${\mathcal E}[X|Y]$$ is uncorrelated with the error $$X- {\mathcal
   E}[X|Y]$$ made in estimating $$X$$ from $$Y$$
