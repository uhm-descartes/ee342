Read Chapter 1.4 of the text.

Points to pay attention to: 

* We have already used the law of total probability multiple times in
 the problems we have done in the Conditional Probability Module. It
 is not a new concept, but simply an observation that the following
 concepts are often used together:
     * the definition of conditional probabilities: $$P(A_i \textrm{ and } B) = P(A_i\cap B)= P(B|A_i)P(A_i)$$, and
     * probability of a disjoint union is the sum of probabilities of the components of the union: $$P( \cup_i (A_i \cap B) ) = \sum_i P(A_i\cap B)$$ for disjoint $$A_i$$.  
	 Can you pinpoint all uses in the problems of prior modules? 

* Bayes theorem seems simple as a standalone formula. But it is not just a formula, we are trying to construct a way of thinking here. Pay attention to how this changes the *formulation* of the problems we solve in class.
