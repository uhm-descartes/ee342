# The development of set theory

Once you get familiar with set comprehension, consider the following (Russell's
paradox): \\(A\\) is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves, specifically

$$A = \{ Z: Z \notin Z \}.$$

The problem now is: is \\(A\\) a member of \\(A\\)? Well, if so, \\(A\notin A\\)
(by the definition of the set). But if not, \\(A\notin A\\), and the
definition above implies \\(A\in A\\). It is akin to saying "This sentence is a lie" (think about it).

This is a paradox where we cannot have either the statement or its
negation to be true. This cuts quite deep not just into math but also
philosophy. A really nice (but some may say unfairly exaggerated in
some aspects) account on the beginnings of set theory in a period of
transformation in math is in the wonderful graphic novel,
[Logicomix](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521).

A small note about Russell's paradox so I don't leave you hanging. The
common version of axioms in set theory in vogue is the Zermelo-Fraenkel
version with the axiom of choice (abbreviated as the ZFC), which
explicitly restricts the generality of set comprehension statements. We
will see the Axiom of Choice in one of the optional [experiences](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/morea/axioms/experience-vitali.html) in the 
next [module](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/modules/module-axioms/)
