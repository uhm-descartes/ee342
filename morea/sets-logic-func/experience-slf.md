# The development of set theory

The entire development of set theory makes for a very good read. See
the graphic novel,
[Logicomix](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521)
for a fictionalized (and some may say, unfairly exaggerated) account
of the beginnings of set theory, logic and foundations of math and
philosophy.
