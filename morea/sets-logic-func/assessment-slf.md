# Problems in class

In all the following, 
\\(\Omega\\) is a set, and \\(S\\), \\(T\\) and \\(U\\) are subsets of \\(\Omega\\).

* Prove that union/intersections distribute over each other, namely
\\(S \cap (T \cup U) = (S \cap T) \cup (S \cap U)\\) and 
\\(S \cup (T \cap U) = (S \cup T) \cap (S \cup U)\\).

* Prove that \\((\bigcup_n S_n)^c = \bigcap_n S_n^c\\), \\((\bigcap_n S_n)^c = \bigcup_n S_n^c\\).

* Let \\(A = \sets{0,1}\times \sets{0,1} \times \sets{0,1}\\)? How many elements does \\(A\\) have?
Write them out.

* If \\(\Omega = \sets{1\upto n}\\), how many elements does the set of all subsets of \\(\Omega\\) have?

We usually call this set the \emph{power set} of \\(\Omega\\), abbreviated as \\(2^{\Omega}\\) (the reason for this notation will soon become clear).
