# Problems in class

In all the following, 
\\(\Omega\\) is a set, and all other sets are subsets of \\(\Omega\\). All
indicator functions are functions from \\(\Omega\\) to \\(\\{0,1\\}\\).

1. Prove that union/intersections distribute over each other, namely
\\(S \cap (T \cup U) = (S \cap T) \cup (S \cap U)\\) and 
\\(S \cup (T \cap U) = (S \cup T) \cap (S \cup U)\\).

2. Prove that \\((\bigcup_n S_n)^c = \bigcap_n S_n^c\\), and that \\((\bigcap_n S_n)^c = \bigcup_n S_n^c\\).

3. Let \\(A = \\{ 0,1 \\} \times \\{ 0,1 \\} \times \\{ 0,1 \\} \\)? How many elements does \\(A\\) have? Write them out.

4. If \\(\Omega = \\{ 1, \ldots,  n \\}\\), how many elements does the set of all subsets of \\(\Omega\\) have? We usually call this set the *power set* of \\(\Omega\\), abbreviated as \\(2^{\Omega}\\) (do you see the reason for this notation?). 

5. Let \\(A_1,\ldots, A_n\\) be subsets of \\(\Omega\\). Can you express
the indicator functions 
$${\mathbf 1}_{A_1\cap A_2\cap \cdots A_n} \textrm{ and } {\mathbf 1}_{A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots A_n}$$ 
in terms of the indicator functions \\({\mathbf 1}_{A_1}\\),
\\({\mathbf 1}_{A_2}\\) \\(\cdots\\) \\({\mathbf 1}_{A_n}\\)?
