A little more about sets, basic definitions of functions and the connections
with logical statements is [here](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/ee342/morea/sets-logic-func/slf.pdf). 

Once you get familiar with set comprehension, consider the following (Russell's
paradox): $A$ is the set of all sets that are not members of themselves, specifically

$$A = \sets{ Z: Z \notin Z}.$$

The problem now is: is $A$ a member of $A$? Well, if so, $A\notin A$
(by the definition of the set). But if not, $A\notin A$, and the
definition above implies $A\in A$. It is akin to saying "This sentence is a lie" (think about it).

This is a paradox where we cannot have either the statement or its
negation to be true. This cuts quite deep not just into math but also
philosophy. A really nice (but exaggerated in some aspects) account on
the beginnings of set theory in a period of transformation in math is
in the wonderful graphic novel, Logicomix.
