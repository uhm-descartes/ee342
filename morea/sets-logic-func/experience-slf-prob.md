# Problems in class


1. Let \\(A = \\{ 0,1 \\} \times \\{ 0,1 \\} \times \\{ 0,1 \\} \\)? How many elements does \\(A\\) have? Write them out.

2. If \\(\Omega = \\{ 1, \ldots,  n \\}\\), how many elements does the set of all subsets of \\(\Omega\\) have? We usually call this set the *power set* of \\(\Omega\\), abbreviated as \\(2^{\Omega}\\) (do you see the reason for this notation?).
