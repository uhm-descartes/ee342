  <h1 id="cantor-set">Cantor Set</h1>
<p>This is advanced material. It is a lot of fun to know and think about,
but you will not be tested in EE342 about any of the following.</p>

<p>The logo you see for this module is a representation of the Cantor
set. This is the way you construct the Cantor set:</p>

<p>Start from the closed interval [0,1]. (A closed interval includes both end points)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the open middle third (ie the interval \((\frac13,
 \frac23)\)). An open interval excludes both end points. Now what
 remains are two closed intervals, \([0,\frac13]\) and \([\frac23,
 1]\). We removed 1/3 of the interval [0,1], (so the sum of lengths
 of the two intervals remaining is 2/3). Carry over these 2
 intervals to next step.</li>
  <li>From steps 2 onwards:
    <ul>
      <li>Step i: There will be \(2^{i-1}\) closed intervals carried over
from the prior step, each with size \(\frac1{3^{i-1}}\). Remove
the middle open one third of each of the \(2^{i-1}\) closed
intervals. As a result, we are left with \(2^i\) closed
intervals, each with size \(\frac1{3^i}\). The length removed
equals \(2^{i-1}/3^i\). Carry the \(2^i\) closed intervals
remaining to the next step. The sum of lengths of the intervals
carried over is \(\frac{2^i}{3^i}\).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Cantor set \(\cal C\) is what remains after you do this procedure for all
natural numbers \(i\ge 1\).</p>

<p>How do you know any element remains after you have done the procedure
for all \(i\ge 1\)? Here is a way to get a handle on what is
happening. In the first step, let us represent every number in the
closed interval [0,1] with its ternary expansion. The ternary (or
binary or decimal) expansions are generally not unique—for example,</p>

\[1/3 = .1_3 = .022222..._3\]

<p>and</p>

\[2/3 = .2_3 = .122222..._3\]

<p>In fact, all numbers of form \(m/3^n\) have two representations as
above. The redundancy in representation happens with decimals too,
since \(.1_{10} = .099999..._{10},\) and so on.</p>

<p>Choose .02222… as our prefered representation of 1/3 and choose .2 for
2/3. Now note that every number in the open middle one third reads
\(.1xxx_3\) (in <em>all</em> its representations).  So the open middle one
third must use a 1 in the first position in any of its ternary
representations. Similarly, after the second step, every number removed
must have a 1 in its second position after the point. And so on.</p>

<p>The numbers that remain are therefore all the numbers that can be
represented without using a 1 in some representation (so 1/3, 2/3 both
survive). These numbers form the Cantor set. In the \(i'\)th step, the
total length of intervals carried over to the next step is
\(\frac{2^i}{3^i}\), so after the construction proceeds for all \(i\),
the total length that remains must be 0. Calculating another way, the
total length removed in step $i$ is \(\frac{2^{i-1}}{3^i}=\frac12
\frac{2^i}{3^i}.\) Summing over all \(i\ge 1\), the total length
removed is</p>

\[\frac12 \Bigl(\frac 23 + (\frac 23)^2 + \cdots \Bigr) =
\frac12 \frac{\frac 23}{1-\frac 23} =1,\]

<p>which means the Cantor set \(\cal C\) has length 0.</p>

<p>But here is where things get really bizzare. We can easily prove that
the Cantor set has the same size as [0,1]. It is easy in fact—we say
\(\cal C\) has at least the size of \([0,1]\) if there is a surjective
(onto) function \(m:{\cal C}\to [0,1]\). Since \(m\) is a function,
every member of \(\cal C\) can map to exactly one element of
\([0,1]\). Because it is surjective, every element \(y \in [0,1]\)
turns out to be the map of some element \(x\in{\cal C}\) (\(y =
m(x)\)). This does not preclude multiple elements in \(\cal C\) 
mapping to the same \(y\in [0,1]\).</p>

<p>There is a natural map: since the ternary expansion of any \(x\in{\cal
C}\) can be written only in terms of 0s and 2s, let us replace every
occurance of 2 with a 1. For example if</p>

\[x = .02220202\]

<p>then we obtain the sequence</p>

\[s = .01110101\]

<p>\(m(x)\) is the number in \([0,1]\) whose <em>binary</em> expansion is \(s\).
Therefore, every element \(x\in{\cal C}\) maps to one infinite binary
sequence \(s\), which in turn maps to one number \(y=m(x)\in[0,1]\).
Every number in \([0,1]\) has at least one binary expansion (there may
be more than 1, for example .1 = .09999…).</p>

<p>Therefore the size of \(\cal C\), which equals the size of all
infinite binary sequences, is at least as large as the size of
\([0,1]\). Conversely, \(\cal C \subset [0,1]\), so the size of
\([0,1]\) is also at least as large as the size of \(\cal C\).</p>

<p>So the two infinite sizes must be the same and the size of this
infinity is called the cardinality of an uncountable set (which is a
bigger infinity than the size of the set of all natural numbers). In
fact the size of \([0,1]\) or the Cantor set must equal the size of
the power set of natural numbers (can you see this?)</p>
