Review the basics of sets, operations on sets (union, intersection,
cartesian products, and algebra of set operations) from Section 1.1 of
the textbook. This may be material you are already familiar with, but
its importance cannot be understated. You will need a little more than 
Section 1.1 for this course, and the rest in the second reading associated
with this topic.

Sets seem deceptively simple, but are also full of unexpected
surprises, and in many ways, the definition and basics of sets is also
the beginnings of modern mathematics. You will get a preview of these
things in this module, and there is a lifetime of things to be explored here.
