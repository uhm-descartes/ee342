Review the basics of sets, operations on sets (union, intersection,
and algebra of set operations) from Section 1.1 of the textbook. This
may be material you are already familiar with, but its importance
cannot be understated.  You have to pay attention to two things that
isn't explicitly mentioned (but used) in the text: Cartesian products
and indicator functions. Please use the handout for these.

The text uses Cartesian products without definition at the top of page
5 when it talks about tuples.  The sets of ordered pairs of real
numbers is called $${\mathbb R}^2$$ in the text. This notation comes
because the set of ordered pairs of real numbers is really the
Cartesian product $${\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}$$ (hence
abbreviated as $${\mathbb R}^2$$). Same for triplets. Thinking in
terms of Cartesian products explicitly has lot of advantages down the
line (and the book uses them too with the assumption you already know
it).

In general, you may think this section is simple or high school stuff.
But the true beauty of this subject is primarily because of how deep
even such basic stuff can be developed, and can yield so many
astonishing conclusions. It is not for nothing that mathematics is
often called the queen of all arts in much of the world (except in the
United States, where we are taught implicitly or explicitly to look
down on it as a tool or to fear it as if it were Sauron). But no longer.
Probability theory is one area in math whose stunning beauty compares
with the rarest of human accomplishments in any endeavor. You will get
a preview of these things in this course among the experiences, and
there is a lifetime of things to be explored starting from there.
