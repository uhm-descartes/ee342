We had mentioned in earlier modules why we need a different way to
handle continuous probability spaces and random variables. In continuous
spaces, we use pdfs to describe random variables, but pdfs are not
probabilities (directly). Rather they are used under an integration
sign to get probabilities. Because of this technical development, a
couple of allied technical concepts: cummulative distribution functions
and "derived" pdfs become helpful (we could have defined them for 
discrete random variables as well, but they would not have been worth
the effort). 

We revisit pdfs again, and learn about a new kind of random variable,
the exponential distribution. In a sense the exponential is a
continuous analog of the geometric distribution, and shares with it
what is called the "memoryless" property. It is very closely connected
with Poisson random variables as well. We learnt in the last module
that the number of chewing gum stains per tile on the sidewalk is a
Poisson process (approximately). Assuming the sidewalk were
one-dimensional (so only length, no width, the tiles are segments on a
line), the distance between stains is an exponential random variable.
