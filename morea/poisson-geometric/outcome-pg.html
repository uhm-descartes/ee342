<ul>
  <li>You understand the probability space of independent Bernoulli trials when the number of trials is not fixed in advance</li>
  <li>Geometric random variables model the time to first success
from repeated independent Bernoulli trials</li>
  <li>Poisson \(\lambda\) r.v. is the limit as \(n\to\infty\) of Binomial(\(n\),
\(\frac{\lambda}n\)), ie large number of rare events</li>
  <li>You can compute the mean and variance of Geometric and Poisson
random variables</li>
</ul>
