  * You understand the probability space of independent Bernoulli trials when the number of trials is not fixed in advance
  * Geometric random variables model the time to first success
    from repeated independent Bernoulli trials
  * Poisson $$\lambda$$ r.v. is the limit as $$n\to\infty$$ of Binomial($$n$$,
    $$\frac{\lambda}n$$), ie large number of rare events
  * You can compute the mean and variance of Geometric and Poisson
    random variables
