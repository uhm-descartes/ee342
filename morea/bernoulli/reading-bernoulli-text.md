In the prior module we focused on the definitions and how they come
about in our development of a probability space. This module focuses
on Bernoulli random variables, and certain natural random variables
that come naturally from independent Bernoulli trials.

Unlike the text, we have always approached multiple random variables
in a common probability space from the very beginning. In the text,
the opposite approach is chosen, by introducing them in Chapter 2.5.
They do not teach different things, merely presenting material in 
different orders. 

The textbook is encyclopediaic, meant for revisiting material you
already know. Introducing the material in the text order has the
unfortunate consequence that students do not grasp the notion of
dependence between random variables, and automatically think
independence is the only recourse.

Chapter 4.4 is mentioned only because we compute the moment generating
functions of Bernoulli, Binomial and Geometric random variables.
