    <p><strong>Maximum Likelihood</strong> The Maximum Likelihood, usually abbreviated
as ML, is going to be our first foray into statistical estimation.
We have learnt that if \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) are independent
copies of a Bernoulli \(p\) random variable, \(Y= X_1+X_2+\ldots+
X_n\) is a Binomial random variable with parameters \(n\) and
\(p\). We flip this around, and ask: if we saw only the \iid
observations, \(X_1, X_2,\ldots, X_n\), could we estimate what \(p\) is?</p>

    <p>If \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) are generated \iid Bernoulli \(p\),
let the probability of \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) be denoted as
\({\mathbb P}(X_1, \ldots, X_n | p)\). The ML principle asks to choose
\(\hat{p}\) in such a way that \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) is no less
likely under the chosen \(\hat{p}\) than under any other value
\(p\) for the parameter. Therefore we maximize, over \(p\),
\({\mathbb P}(X_1, \ldots, X_n | p)\).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Find \(\hat{p} = \arg\max {\mathbb P}(X_1, \ldots, X_n | p)\). Now
  \(\hat{p}\) is a function of the random variables \(X_1, \ldots,
  X_n\), and therefore a random variable itself. Express
  \(\hat{p}\) in terms of \(Y\).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As noted above \(Y=X_1+\ldots + X_n\). Find \(\hat{p} = \arg\max
  {\mathbb P}(Y | p)\)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What is \({\mathbb P}(X_1, \ldots, X_n | Y, p)\)? This question
anticipates the next module. Note that this conditional
probability does not depend on \(p\), namely that given \(Y\),
\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\) cannot give any further information about
\(p\).  For this reason, \(Y\) is called a <em>sufficient
statistic</em> for \iid Bernoulli trials. Whatever we can get about
\(p\) from \(X_1, \ldots, X_n\), we can get it from \(Y\) alone.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>A flaw in the ML procedure is brought to light when \(Y=0\) (or
\(Y=n\)). Notice that when \(Y=0\), \(\hat{p}=0\), meaning that the
ML model is Bernoulli 0 (and hence 0 probability of seeing a one
ever). But, particularly if \(n\) is small, the fact that we have
not seen a one so far may be just coincidence, we shouldn’t
summarily exclude it from consideration altogether. It may be
better to assign a small but non-zero value for the parameter. In
that sense, the ML procedure is a little aggressive, and it perhaps
overvalues the observations. This is the “unseen event” or “missing
mass” problem. We will look at it in the next module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communication Link</strong> We have looked at a basic Binary Symmetric
Channel. Here is a Binary Erasure Channel, more in line with the
engineering approach to sending data in packets on the Internet. In
a binary erasure channel, the input is a bit. Given an input bit,
the output equals the input with probability \(1-\epsilon\) or an
erasure with probability \(\epsilon\). For the sake of notation, we
will denote an erasure by the number \(\frac12\). In this case, if
you see a bit at the output, you know the channel introduced no
error. If you see an erasure, you do not know what the input
is. Let the input be \(X\), taking values in \(\{0,1\}\), and the
output is \(Y\), taking values in \(\{0,1,\frac12\}\). Assume
\(X\) is Bernoulli \(p\).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Let \(E = {\mathbf 1}(|X-Y|&gt;0)\). Note that \(E\) is an
indicator for an erasure (it is 1 if there is an erasure and 0
if not). Show that \(E\) is independent of \(X\)</li>
      <li>What is the conditional distribution on \(X\) given (i) \(Y=0\),
(ii) \(Y=\frac12\), and (iii) \(Y=1\).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In practice, the channel is used not once but several times.  Let
the channel be used \(n\) times. Assume further that the channel
acts on each input bit independently of what happened in other
channel uses. Specifically, let \(E_i\) indicate whether the
\(i'\)th bit was erased. Our model says that \(E_i\) are independent.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There are many other ways the channel can act on the input bits
other than independently, and still satisfy the individual
channel use model: each \(E_i\) is independent of \(X_i\) and is
a Bernoulli \(\epsilon\) random variable. Can you come up with 
another model for the \(E_1,\ldots E_n\), preserving the
individual channel use model, but such that \(E_1,\ldots E_n\)
are not independent?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Suppose we have access to an oracle who can tell the transmitter
whether the input bit went through or whether it was erased. Then
consider the following natural oracle-aided communication strategy:
the transmitter retransmits a bit till it goes through. Depending
on how many erasures happen among the \(n\) channel uses, the
number of bits that make it across the receiver changes. Let
\(R_n\) denote the number of transmitted bits.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Show that \(R_n = n - \sum_{i=1}^n E_i\).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The rate of transmission is defined to be</p>

    <p>\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{ {\mathbb E} R_n}n\).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Show that \({\mathbb E} R_n = n(1-\epsilon)\). Therefore, the
rate of transmission of information is \(1-\epsilon\).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Incidentally, it can be shown (though it is a lot deeper) that you
can achieve arbitrarily close to this rate even without an
oracle. And more remarkably, it can also be shown that no scheme,
however advanced or smart, can have a better rate than \(1-\epsilon\).</p>

    <p>Therefore the quantity \(1-\epsilon\) is a fundamental property of
the Binary Erasure channel, and is called its <em>capacity</em>, the
maximum amount of information that we could push through. All
physical channels are modeled as above as conditional probabilities
of the output given every possible value of the input. All such
channels have a capacity associated with.</p>

    <p>A big part of engineering in communications often involves
understanding these limits and finding better and creative
techniques to create channels with greater capacities. This is the
bread and butter of companies like Qualcomm, Broadcomm and others
(whose techniques are in almost every phone in North America).</p>

    <p>Most of you have probably never seen a telephone dialup modem,
which used the voice range of the telephone line to carry internet
data. The capacity of such a channel, calculated using the same
theory as above, was 56k bits/second. This is a fundamental speed
limit, and no technology can circumvent the 56k barrier on the
voice range of a telephone channel. Therefore, DSL was developed to
use frequencies outside the voice range for data
communication. Today, the speed increases Hawaii Telecom touts for
DSL typically results from shortening distances to the first
digital relay in the provider infrastructure. Similarly, the
evolution from the 2G -&gt; 3G -&gt; 4G -&gt; 5G networks with increasing
communication speeds resulted in figuring out ever more creative
ways to build effective channels with greater capacities, for
example, by using more antennas, packet or message switching, OFDM,
mmWave range, beamforming and others.</p>
