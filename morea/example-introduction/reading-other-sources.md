This is a fundamentally important topic, but also one with a lot of
misconceptions. The combination provides a market for a lot of
material online. There are YouTube videos, which admittedly can be way
more slick than your millennial, GenX or older professor (forgive me
if I got the labels wrong!).

I watch Number Blocks with my toddler, and I know how useful these can
be. Past students have told me about 3blue1brown, Zach Star (though
this is more for EE 345), Khan Academy and I am sure there are many
others. It is hard to give an overview of all resources since there
are so many of them. But I did watch all the 3blue1brown and Khan Academy
videos on probability so I could tell you how to best use these resources. 

The short (and unfortunately unkind) answer is that these (3blue1brown
or Khan Academy) are videos you must see _before_ you start the
material in class. They are at high school, not an undergraduate
level. High school level is where _you_ think you understand, but your
teacher (or the person making these videos) also knows you have been
gently lulled into thinking so. It has its utility, because at this
stage of development, giving you the confidence you can do something
is often more important than the content. 

The answer is also unkind because high school instruction is very
variable. It is not your fault if you haven't seen this before in high
school. It is not on you. But if you haven't, as suggested in various
modules, please try to watch the videos at least before we take up the
content in class. You don't have to understand everything, but you
should watch it. And then ask questions in class (reference
the video you watched, we will watch it together and I can comment). 

In a nutshell, here is the best use I can think of for this resource:
**watch these videos and use the content to _challenge_ me in class**.

At undergraduate level, you see the same topics all over again in some
of the more fundamental subjects like probability or linear
algebra. But this time you are more capable. Someone will tell you
that you can pass an undergraduate course with high school knowledge.
They would be right, and honestly, there _is_ rampant grade inflation
(though not for the reasons you would think---the reason for grade
inflation is often the hope that it will encourage you to learn _some_
day if not today). But then you are not getting out of this course
what you can.

So these fundamental topics are now presented in more powerful and
deeper ways, more in line with how "grown ups" do things. As a
consequence, the undergraduate level reshapes your world. You are
still protected from the true extent of how far gone these topics are
(see the experiences in each module), but not as much as in high
school.

Each time you relearn these topics, it is not comfortable, and it is
not meant to be. But it is wonderful if you have the attitude that you
have to figure these things out. By the undergraduate/beginning graduate
level, you would have rewired your thinking to adapt these axioms as
well.
