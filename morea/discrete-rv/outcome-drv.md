  * You understand what functions are, and what a random variable is
  * You understand composition of functions, and functions of random variables
  * You understand the pmf on (individual and multple) discrete random variables
  * You can compute the expectation of random variables (and their functions)
  * If $$X_1$$ and $$X_2$$ are independent random variables $${\mathbb E}[X_1X_2] = {\mathbb E}[X_1] {\mathbb E}[X_2]$$
  * You understand why the expectation is a linear function of the random variables
  * You can compute the higher moments of a random variable, in particular the variance
  * You can define the moment generating function
  * You understand why the moment generating function is called as such
