<p>These problems will show you the power of formalism. You have
implicitly used random variables before, and it may not be clear why
we make this so formal. The first example is primarily to get our feet
wet. The next one, on Quicksort, shows the power of this approach.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Coin Tosses</strong> Suppose we have \(n\) independent coin tosses, each
coin having a probability of showing heads to be \(p\). In prior
modules, we worked out cases for a specific, small value of \(n\), now
we can wade in a little deeper.
    <ul>
      <li>Write a sample space for the experiment.</li>
      <li>For \(1\le i\le n\), let \(X_i\) be the indicator that the
   \(i\)‘th coin toss is heads. Note the explanation of indicator
   from class, this will be very commonly reused. What is
   \({\mathbb E} [X_i]\)?</li>
      <li>Let \(N= X_1+ X_2 +\ldots + X_n\). \(N\) is now another random
   variable. What would be a good interpretation for this random
   variable?</li>
      <li>What is \({\mathbb E}[ N]\)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now we will pose a very similar looking problem, but we will only
  specify the probability space partially. Specifying models
  partially is quite realistic—in many applications, we cannot
  truly get the full picture, but we still need to know what we can
  infer from the partial model. For the following parts, we still
  have a sequence of \(n\) toss outcomes, and each toss outcome has
  probability \(p\) of being heads. But I do not tell you
  anything more about the probability model, specifically, how the
  different tosses depend on each other.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you come up with a probability model on the \(n\) outcomes
  (of course, consistent with the fact that each toss has
  probability \(p\) of being heads), but something different from
  the independent coin flips of the previous part?</li>
      <li>Once again, for \(1\le i\le n\), let \(X_i\) be the indicator
   that the \(i\)‘th toss is heads.  What is \({\mathbb E}
   [X_i]\)?</li>
      <li>Let \(N= X_1+ X_2 +\ldots + X_n\). What is \({\mathbb E} [N]\)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notice how we can answer the above questions even though we don’t
  have the full probability model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quicksort</strong> Let us go back to Quicksort from prior modules. In
this episode, we will see the probability any two elements are
directly compared (in any step) of the Quicksort algorithm run on
\(n\) elements, and thereby compute the average number of
comparisons required for any sequence. Recall the probability space
we wrote for this problem, but assume that the starting sequence is
fixed. Equivalently, we are conditioning on the starting sequence.</p>

    <p>We will adopt the following notation: for \(1\le i\le n\), we will
denote by \(e_i\), the \(i'\)th smallest element in the list. We may
not know as soon as we see a sequence which element it is, but it
is one of the elements in the list.</p>

    <p>We want to know the probability that element \(e_i\) and \(e_j\)
are compared. To get this probability, we make the following
observation: let \(S = \{ e_i, e_{i+1}, \ldots, e_{j-1},
e_j\}\). In the beginning, all elements of \(S\) are in the same
group (all \(n\) elements are).  As long as no element of \(S\) is
chosen as the pivot, all elements of \(S\) continue to be in the
same group (and no element of \(S\) is compared with any other
element of \(S\)). The set \(S\) gets split into two groups the
moment an element of \(S\) gets chosen as the
pivot. And if so, during the split, \(e_i\) and \(e_j\) are
compared directly only if one of \(e_i\) or \(e_j\) is chosen
as the pivot. If not, \(e_i\) and \(e_j\) are never compared 
directly in any future step (since they will now be in different groups).</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What is the probability that, given that a pivot is chosen among
the elements of \(S\), the pivot is either \(e_i\) or \(e_j\)?
This is also the probability that \(e_i\) and \(e_j\) are
compared directly in any step of the Quicksort algorithm.</li>
      <li>Let \(X_{ij}\) be the indicator for whether \(e_i\) and \(e_j\) are ever
directly compared in the entire run of the Quicksort algorithm. What
is \({\mathbb E} [X_{ij}]\)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Believe it or not, we now know the average running time of the Quicksort
Algorithm. Let</p>

\[M= \sum_{1\le i\le n} \sum_{ i \le j\le n} X_{ij}\]

    <ul>
      <li>What is a good interpretation for \(M\)?</li>
      <li>What is \({\mathbb E} [M]\)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And there you go! You have done the first grown-up analysis. \(M\)
is random, and depends on the choice of pivots. Different random
choices could lead to different values of \(M\). But what we show
is that the average value of \(M\) is \({\mathcal O}(n\log n)\),
far smaller than the worst case value of \(n(n-1)/2\) (where every
pair of elements are compared).</p>

    <p>While \(X_{ij}\) are binary valued variables, like in the second
part of the previous problem, we do not know anything about their
dependence.  Typically, to compute averages, these dependences are
unnecessary.  But of course, as we discussed in class, the
concentration of \(M\) around \({\mathbb E}M\) is not known, so we
don’t immediately know if this is a really good algorithm that uses
\(n\log n\) comparisons most of the time or not. To get a picture of
the concentration around the expectation, we need to unravel a little
bit about the dependencies between the random variables \(X_{ij}\) 
for different values of \(i,j\). We will do this in future modules.</p>
  </li>
