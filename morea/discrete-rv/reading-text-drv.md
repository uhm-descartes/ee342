Chapter 2.2: In this module we focus primarily on how the definition
of a pmf comes about from our development of a probability space. The
specific examples listed will be deferred to the next module. 

In Chapters 2.3-2.5 as well, some of the examples may
be unfamiliar, we leave the examples for the next module. In this Chapter,
it is more important to focus on how the definitions come about and why
they make sense. You shouldn't have to memorize "formulae" for computing
expectations of functions of random variables, or memorize any "property"
if you understood the core (what a random is, and how a pmf is induced
on a discrete random variable). 

Chapter 2.5, appreciating multiple random variables in a single
probability space is very important. Pay attention to the running
example in class when we explore all these concepts.

In Chapter 4.4, we are only focusing on the definition of the MGF, and
to motivate why we look at moments of a random variable. 

The next module will reflect the same structure as this, but with
specific examples of random variables which are very important.
